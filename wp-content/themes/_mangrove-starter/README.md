<h1>WP BOOTSTRAP</h1>

<p>Bootstrap (http://getbootstrap.com) in WordPress theme form.</p>

<p>Used Eddie Machado&rsquo;s Bones for a starting point (https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones) but it doesn&rsquo;t look too much like it any longer.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>

<hr />

<p>We’ve built the WP Bootstrap theme so that it could be used as-is as a very basic theme or as a starting point for theme developers. It’s built on top of the Bones theme framework by Eddie Machado and based on v3.0.3 of Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Watch or star this project to keep up with its progress.</p>

<p>Multi-Lingual</p>

<hr />

<p>WP-Bootstrap is translated in 4 languages - Spanish, French, Portuguese and German.</p>

<p>Page Templates</p>

<hr />

<p>We’ve packaged four different page templates into this theme.</p>

<pre><code>- Homepage template (seen on the homepage of this site - http://www.320press.com/wp-bootstrap)
- Standard page with right sidebar (this page)
- Page with left sidebar
- Full width page
</code></pre>

<p>Theme Options Panel</p>

<hr />

<p>We&rsquo;ve removed the custom theme options panel in version 3.0. Currently working on moving all of the options that used to appear there over to the theme customizer.</p>

<p>Shortcodes</p>

<hr />

<p>We’ve built in some shortcodes so you can easily add UI elements found in Bootstrap.</p>

<p>Sidebars</p>

<hr />

<p>There are two different sidebars. One for the homepage and one for the other pages. Add widgets to them.</p>
